S3 benchmarking tool.

# configuration

Warp can be configured either using commandline parameters or environment variables. The S3 server to use can be specified on the commandline using `--host`, `--access-key`, `--secret-key` and optionally `--tls` to specify TLS.

It is also possible to set the same parameters using the `WARP_HOST`, `WARP_ACCESS_KEY`, `WARP_SECRET_KEY` and `WARP_TLS` environment variables.

The credentials must be able to create, delete and list buckets and upload files and perform the operation requested.

By default operations are performed on a bucket called `warp-benchmark-bucket`. This can be changed using the `--bucket` parameter. Do however note that the bucket will be completely cleaned before and after each run, so it should *not* contain any data.

If you are [running TLS](https://docs.min.io/docs/how-to-secure-access-to-minio-server-with-tls.html), you can enable [server-side-encryption](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/ServerSideEncryptionCustomerKeys.html) of objects using `--encrypt`. A random key will be generated and used for objects.

# usage

`warp command [options]`

# benchmarks

All benchmarks operate concurrently. By default the processor determines the number of operations that will be running concurrently. This can however also be tweaked using the `--concurrent` parameter.

Tweaking concurrency can have an impact on performance, especially if latency to the server is tested. Most benchmarks will also use different prefixes for each "thread" running.

By default all benchmarks save all request details to a file named `warp-operation-yyyy-mm-dd[hhmmss]-xxxx.csv.zst`. A custom file name can be specified using the `--benchdata` parameter. The raw data is [zstandard](https://facebook.github.io/zstd/) compressed CSV data.

# distributed benchmarking

It is possible to coordinate several warp instances automatically.
This can be useful for testing performance of a cluster from several clients at once.

For reliable benchmarks, clients should have synchronized clocks.
Warp checks whether clocks are within one second of the server,
but ideally, clocks should be synchronized with [NTP](http://www.ntp.org/) or a similar service.

## client setup

WARNING: Never run warp clients on a publicly exposed port. Clients have the potential to DDOS any service.

Clients are started with

```
warp client [listenaddress:port]
```

`warp client` Only accepts an optional host/ip to listen on, but otherwise no specific parameters.
By default warp will listen on `127.0.0.1:7761`.

Only one server can be connected at the time.
However, when a benchmark is done, the client can immediately run another one with different parameters.

There will be a version check to ensure that clients are compatible with the server,
but it is always recommended to keep warp versions the same.

## server setup

Any benchmark can be run in server mode.
When warp is invoked as a server no actual benchmarking will be done on the server.
Each client will execute the benchmark.

The server will coordinate the benchmark runs and make sure they are run correctly.

When the benchmark has finished, the combined benchmark info will be collected, merged and saved/displayed.
Each client will also save its own data locally.

Enabling server mode is done by adding `--warp-client=client-{1...10}:7761` or a comma separated list of warp client hosts.
If no host port is specified the default is added.

Example:

```
warp get --duration=10m --warp-client=client-{1...10} --host=minio-server-{1...16} --access-key=minio --secret-key=minio123
```

Note that parameters apply to *each* client. So if `concurrent=8` is specified each client will run with 8 concurrent operations. If a warp server is unable to connect to a client the entire benchmark is aborted.

If the warp server looses connection to a client during a benchmark run an error will be displayed and the server will attempt to reconnect. If the server is unable to reconnect, the benchmark will continue with the remaining clients.

## benchmark data

By default warp uploads random data.

### Object Size

Most benchmarks use the `-obj.size` parameter to decide the size of objects to upload.

#### Random File Sizes

It is possible to randomize object sizes by specifying  `-obj.randsize` and files will have a "random" size up to `-obj.size`.
However, there are some things to consider "under the hood".

We use log2 to distribute objects sizes.
This means that objects will be distributed in equal number for each doubling of the size.
This means that `obj.size/64` -> `obj.size/32` will have the same number of objects as `obj.size/2` -> `obj.size`.

Example of objects (horizontally) and their sizes, 100MB max:

![objects (horizontally) and their sizes](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5663952/71828619-83381480-3057-11ea-9d6c-ff03607a66a7.png)

To see segmented request statistics, use the `-requests` parameter.

```
λ warp analyze warp-get-2020-01-07[024225]-QWK3.csv.zst -requests -analyze.op=GET

 * Slowest: 1061.56 MiB/s, 47.76 obj/s (1s, starting 02:42:44 PST)
```

## automatic termination
Adding `--autoterm` parameter will enable automatic termination when results are considered stable. To detect a stable setup, warp continuously downsample the current data to 25 data points stretched over the current timeframe.

For a benchmark to be considered "stable", the last 7 of 25 data points must be within a specified percentage. Looking at the throughput over time, it could look like this:

![stable](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5663952/72053512-0df95900-327c-11ea-8bc5-9b4064fa595f.png)

The red frame shows the window used to evaluate stability. The height of the box is determined by the threshold percentage of the current speed. This percentage is user configurable through `--autoterm.pct`, default 7.5%. The metric used for this is either MiB/s or obj/s depending on the benchmark type.

To make sure there is a good sample data, a minimum duration of the 7 of 25 samples is set. This is configurable `--autoterm.dur`. This specifies the minimum time length the benchmark must have been stable.

If the benchmark doesn't autoterminate it will continue until the duration is reached. This cannot be used when benchmarks are running remotely.

A permanent 'drift' in throughput will prevent automatic termination, if the drift is more than the specified percentage. This is by design since this should be recorded.

When using automatic termination be aware that you should not compare average speeds, since the length of the benchmark runs will likely be different. Instead 50% medians are a much better metrics.

## multiple hosts

Multiple hosts can be specified as comma-separated values, for instance `10.0.0.1:9000,10.0.0.2:9000` will switch between the specified servers.

Alternatively numerical ranges can be specified using `10.0.0.{1...10}:9000` which will add `10.0.0.1` through `10.0.0.10`.
This syntax can be used for any part of the host name and port.

By default a host is chosen between the hosts that have the least number of requests running and with the longest time since the last request finished. This will ensure that in cases where hosts operate at different speeds that the fastest servers will get the most requests. It is possible to choose a simple round-robin algorithm by using the `--host-select=roundrobin` parameter. If there is only one host this parameter has no effect.

When running benchmarks on several clients, it is possible to synchronize their start time using the `--syncstart` parameter. The time format is 'hh:mm' where hours are specified in 24h format, and parsed as local server time. Using this will make it more reliable to [merge benchmarks](https://github.com/minio/warp#merging-benchmarks) from the clients for total result.

When benchmarks are done per host averages will be printed out. For further details, the `--analyze.hostdetails` parameter can also be used.

## mixed

Mixed mode benchmark will test several operation types at once.  The benchmark will upload `--objects` objects of size `--obj.size`  and use these objects as a pool for the benchmark. As new objects are uploaded/deleted they are added/removed from the pool.

The distribution of operations can be adjusted with the `--get-distrib`, `--stat-distrib`, `--put-distrib` and `--delete-distrib` parameters.  The final distribution will be determined by the fraction of each value of the total. Note that `put-distrib` must be bigger or equal to `--delete-distrib` to not eventually run out of objects.  To disable a type, set its distribution to 0.

Example:
```
λ warp mixed --duration=1m
[...]
Mixed operations.

Operation: GET
 * 632.28 MiB/s, 354.78 obj/s (59.993s, starting 07:44:05 PST) (45.0% of operations)

Operation: STAT
 * 236.38 obj/s (59.966s, starting 07:44:05 PST) (30.0% of operations)

Operation: PUT
 * 206.11 MiB/s, 118.23 obj/s (59.994s, starting 07:44:05 PST) (15.0% of operations)

Operation: DELETE
 * 78.91 obj/s (59.927s, starting 07:44:05 PST) (10.0% of operations)
```

It is possible to get request statistics by adding the `--requests` parameter:
```
λ warp mixed --duration=1m --requests
Mixed operations.

Operation: GET
 * 725.42 MiB/s, 72.54 obj/s (59.961s, starting 07:07:34 PST) (45.0% of operations)

Requests considered: 4304:
 * Avg: 131ms 50%: 124ms 90%: 300ms 99%: 495ms Fastest: 7ms Slowest: 700ms
 * First Byte: Average: 6ms, Median: 3ms, Best: 0s, Worst: 185ms

[...]
```

If multiple hosts were used statistics for each host will also be displayed.

## get

Benchmarking get operations will upload `--objects` objects of size `--obj.size` and attempt to download as many it can within `--duration`.

Objects will be uploaded with `--concurrent` different prefixes, except if `--noprefix` is specified. Downloads are chosen randomly between all uploaded data.

When downloading, the benchmark will attempt to run `--concurrent` concurrent downloads.

The analysis will include the upload stats as `PUT` operations and the `GET` operations.
```
Operation: GET
* Average: 2344.50 MiB/s, 234.45 obj/s, 234.44 ops ended/s (59.119s)

Aggregated, split into 59 x 1s time segments:
* Fastest: 2693.83 MiB/s, 269.38 obj/s, 269.00 ops ended/s (1s)
* 50% Median: 2419.56 MiB/s, 241.96 obj/s, 240.00 ops ended/s (1s)
* Slowest: 1137.36 MiB/s, 113.74 obj/s, 112.00 ops ended/s (1s)
```

The `GET` operations will contain the time until the first byte was received.
This can be accessed using the `-requests` parameter.

## put

Benchmarking put operations will upload objects of size `--obj.size` until `--duration` time has elapsed.

Objects will be uploaded with `--concurrent` different prefixes, except if `--noprefix` is specified.

```
Operation: PUT
* Average: 971.75 MiB/s, 97.18 obj/s, 97.16 ops ended/s (59.417s)

Aggregated, split into 59 x 1s time segments:
* Fastest: 1591.40 MiB/s, 159.14 obj/s, 161.00 ops ended/s (1s)
* 50% Median: 919.79 MiB/s, 91.98 obj/s, 95.00 ops ended/s (1s)
* Slowest: 347.95 MiB/s, 34.80 obj/s, 32.00 ops ended/s (1s)
```

## delete

Benchmarking delete operations will upload `--objects` objects of size `--obj.size` and attempt to
delete as many it can within `--duration`.

The delete operations are done in `--batch` objects per request in `--concurrent` concurrently running requests.

If there are no more objects left the benchmark will end.

The analysis will include the upload stats as `PUT` operations and the `DELETE` operations.

```
Operation: DELETE 100 objects per operation
* Average: 2520.27 obj/s, 25.03 ops ended/s (38.554s)

Aggregated, split into 38 x 1s time segments:
* Fastest: 2955.85 obj/s, 36.00 ops ended/s (1s)
* 50% Median: 2538.10 obj/s, 25.00 ops ended/s (1s)
* Slowest: 1919.86 obj/s, 23.00 ops ended/s (1s)
```

## list

Benchmarking list operations will upload `--objects` objects of size `--obj.size` with `--concurrent` prefixes. The list operations are done per prefix.

The analysis will include the upload stats as `PUT` operations and the `LIST` operations separately. The time from request start to first object is recorded as well and can be accessed using the `--requests` parameter.

```
Operation: LIST 833 objects per operation
* Average: 30991.05 obj/s, 37.10 ops ended/s (59.387s)

Aggregated, split into 59 x 1s time segments:
* Fastest: 31831.96 obj/s, 39.00 ops ended/s (1s)
* 50% Median: 31199.61 obj/s, 38.00 ops ended/s (1s)
* Slowest: 27917.33 obj/s, 35.00 ops ended/s (1s)
```

## stat

Benchmarking [stat object](https://docs.min.io/docs/golang-client-api-reference#StatObject) operations will upload `--objects` objects of size `--obj.size` with `--concurrent` prefixes.

The main benchmark will do individual requests to get object information for the uploaded objects.

Since the object size is of little importance, only objects per second is reported.

Example:
```
$ warp stat --autoterm
[...]
-------------------
Operation: STAT. Concurrency: 12. Hosts: 1.
* Average: 9536.72 obj/s (36.592s, starting 04:46:38 PST)

Aggregated Throughput, split into 36 x 1s time segments:
 * Fastest: 10259.67 obj/s (1s, starting 04:46:38 PST)
 * 50% Median: 9585.33 obj/s (1s, starting 04:47:05 PST)
 * Slowest: 8897.26 obj/s (1s, starting 04:47:06 PST)
```

# analysis

When benchmarks have finished all request data will be saved to a file and an analysis will be shown.

The saved data can be re-evaluated by running `warp analyze (filename)`.

It is possible to merge analyses from concurrent runs using the `warp merge file1 file2 ...`. This will combine the data as if it was run on the same client. Only the time segments that was actually overlapping will be considered. This is based on the absolute time of each recording, so be sure that clocks are reasonably synchronized or use the `--syncstart` parameter.

## analysis data

All analysis will be done on a reduced part of the full data. The data aggregation will *start* when all threads have completed one request and the time segment will *stop* when the last request of a thread is initiated.

This is to exclude variations due to warm-up and threads finishing at different times.
Therefore the analysis time will typically be slightly below the selected benchmark duration.

In this run "only" 42.9 seconds are included in the aggregate data, due to big payload size and low throughput:
```
Operation: PUT
* Average: 37.19 MiB/s, 0.37 obj/s, 0.33 ops ended/s (42.957s)
```

The benchmark run is then divided into fixed duration *segments* specified by `-analyze.dur`, default 1s. For each segment the throughput is calculated across all threads.

The analysis output will display the fastest, slowest and 50% median segment.
```
Aggregated, split into 59 x 1s time segments:
* Fastest: 2693.83 MiB/s, 269.38 obj/s, 269.00 ops ended/s (1s)
* 50% Median: 2419.56 MiB/s, 241.96 obj/s, 240.00 ops ended/s (1s)
* Slowest: 1137.36 MiB/s, 113.74 obj/s, 112.00 ops ended/s (1s)
```

### analysis parameters

Beside the important `--analysis.dur` which specifies the time segment size for aggregated data there are some additional parameters that can be used.

Specifying `--analyze.hostdetails` will output time aggregated data per host instead of just averages. For instance:

```
Throughput by host:
 * http://127.0.0.1:9001: Avg: 81.48 MiB/s, 81.48 obj/s (4m59.976s)
        - Fastest: 86.46 MiB/s, 86.46 obj/s (1s)
        - 50% Median: 82.23 MiB/s, 82.23 obj/s (1s)
        - Slowest: 68.14 MiB/s, 68.14 obj/s (1s)
 * http://127.0.0.1:9002: Avg: 81.48 MiB/s, 81.48 obj/s (4m59.968s)
        - Fastest: 87.36 MiB/s, 87.36 obj/s (1s)
        - 50% Median: 82.28 MiB/s, 82.28 obj/s (1s)
        - Slowest: 68.40 MiB/s, 68.40 obj/s (1s)
```


`--analyze.op=GET` will only analyze GET operations.

Specifying `--analyze.host=http://127.0.0.1:9001` will only consider data from this specific host.

Warp will automatically discard the time taking the first and last request of all threads to finish.
However, if you would like to discard additional time from the aggregated data,
this is possible. For instance `analyze.skip=10s` will skip the first 10 seconds of data for each operation type.

Note that skipping data will not always result in the exact reduction in time for the aggregated data
since the start time will still be aligned with requests starting.

### per request statistics

By adding the `--requests` parameter it is possible to display per request statistics.

This is not enabled by default, since it is assumed the benchmarks are throughput limited,
but in certain scenarios it can be useful to determine problems with individual hosts for instance.

Example:

```
Operation: GET. Concurrency: 12. Hosts: 7.

Requests - 16720:
 * Fastest: 2.9965ms Slowest: 62.9993ms 50%: 21.0006ms 90%: 31.0021ms 99%: 41.0016ms
 * First Byte: Average: 20.575134ms, Median: 20.0007ms, Best: 1.9985ms, Worst: 62.9993ms

Requests by host:
 * http://127.0.0.1:9001 - 2395 requests:
        - Fastest: 2.9965ms Slowest: 55.0015ms 50%: 18.0002ms 90%: 28.001ms
        - First Byte: Average: 17.139147ms, Median: 16.9998ms, Best: 1.9985ms, Worst: 53.0026ms
 * http://127.0.0.1:9002 - 2395 requests:
        - Fastest: 4.999ms Slowest: 60.9925ms 50%: 20.9993ms 90%: 31.001ms
        - First Byte: Average: 20.174683ms, Median: 19.9996ms, Best: 3.999ms, Worst: 59.9912ms

        - Fastest: 6.9988ms Slowest: 56.0005ms 50%: 20.9978ms 90%: 31.001ms
        - First Byte: Average: 20.272876ms, Median: 19.9983ms, Best: 5.0012ms, Worst: 55.0012ms
 * http://127.0.0.1:9004 - 2395 requests:
        - Fastest: 5.0002ms Slowest: 62.9993ms 50%: 22.0009ms 90%: 33.001ms
        - First Byte: Average: 22.039164ms, Median: 21.0015ms, Best: 4.0003ms, Worst: 62.9993ms
 * http://127.0.0.1:9005 - 2396 requests:
        - Fastest: 6.9934ms Slowest: 54.002ms 50%: 21.0008ms 90%: 30.9998ms
        - First Byte: Average: 20.871833ms, Median: 20.0006ms, Best: 4.9998ms, Worst: 52.0019ms
 * http://127.0.0.1:9006 - 2396 requests:
        - Fastest: 6.0019ms Slowest: 54.9972ms 50%: 22.9985ms 90%: 33.0007ms
        - First Byte: Average: 22.430863ms, Median: 21.9986ms, Best: 5.0008ms, Worst: 53.9981ms
 * http://127.0.0.1:9007 - 2396 requests:
        - Fastest: 7.9968ms Slowest: 55.0899ms 50%: 21.998ms 90%: 30.9998ms
        - First Byte: Average: 21.049681ms, Median: 20.9989ms, Best: 6.9958ms, Worst: 54.0884ms
```

The fastest and slowest request times are shown, as well as selected percentiles and the total amount is requests considered.

Note that different metrics are used to select the number of requests per host and for the combined, so there will likely be differences.

### csv output

It is possible to output the CSV data of analysis using `--analyze.out=filename.csv` which will write the CSV data to the specified file.

These are the data fields exported:

| Header              | Description                                                                                       |

| `ops_started`       | Operations started within segment                                                                 |
| `ops_ended`         | Operations ended within the segment                                                               |
| `errors`            | Errors logged on operations ending within the segment                                             |
| `mb_per_sec`        | MiB/s of operations within the segment (*distributed*)                                             |
| `ops_ended_per_sec` | Operations that ended within the segment per second                                               |
| `objs_per_sec`      | Objects per second processed in the segment (*distributed*)                                       |
| `start_time`        | Absolute start time of the segment                                                                |
| `end_time`          | Absolute end time of the segment                                                                  |

Some of these fields are *distributed*. This means that the data of partial operations have been distributed across the segments they occur in. The bigger a percentage of the operation is within a segment the larger part of it has been attributed there.

This is why there can be a partial object attributed to a segment, because only a part of the operation took place in the segment.

## comparing benchmarks

It is possible to compare two recorded runs using the `warp cmp (file-before) (file-after)` to
see the differences between before and after.
There is no need for 'before' to be chronologically before 'after', but the differences will be shown
as change from 'before' to 'after'.

An example:
```
λ warp cmp warp-get-2019-11-29[125341]-7ylR.csv.zst warp-get-2019-202011-29[124533]-HOhm.csv.zst
-------------------
Operation: PUT
Duration: 1m4s -> 1m2s
* Average: +2.63% (+1.0 MiB/s) throughput, +2.63% (+1.0) obj/s
* Fastest: -4.51% (-4.1) obj/s
* 50% Median: +3.11% (+1.1 MiB/s) throughput, +3.11% (+1.1) obj/s
* Slowest: +1.66% (+0.4 MiB/s) throughput, +1.66% (+0.4) obj/s
-------------------
Operation: GET
Operations: 16768 -> 171105
Duration: 30s -> 5m0s
* Average: +2.10% (+11.7 MiB/s) throughput, +2.10% (+11.7) obj/s
* First Byte: Average: -405.876µs (-2%), Median: -2.1µs (-0%), Best: -998.1µs (-50%), Worst: +41.0014ms (+65%)
* Fastest: +2.35% (+14.0 MiB/s) throughput, +2.35% (+14.0) obj/s
* 50% Median: +2.81% (+15.8 MiB/s) throughput, +2.81% (+15.8) obj/s
* Slowest: -10.02% (-52.0) obj/s
```

All relevant differences are listed. This is two `warp get` runs.
Differences in parameters will be shown.

The usual analysis parameters can be applied to define segment lengths.

## merging benchmarks

It is possible to merge runs from several clients using the `warp merge (file1) (file2) [additional files...]` command.

The command will output a combined data file with all data that overlap in time.

The combined output will effectively be the same as having run a single benchmark with a higher concurrency setting.
The main reason for running the benchmark on several clients would be to help eliminate client bottlenecks.

It is important to note that only data that strictly overlaps in absolute time will be considered for analysis.

When running benchmarks on several clients it is likely a good idea to specify the `--noclear` parameter so clients don't accidentally delete each others data on startup or shutdown.

# server profiling

When running against a MinIO server it is possible to enable profiling while the benchmark is running.

This is done by adding `--serverprof=type` parameter with the type of profile you would like. This requires that the credentials allows admin access for the first host.

| Type  | Description                                                                                                                                |
|-------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| cpu   | CPU profile determines where a program spends its time while actively consuming CPU cycles (as opposed while sleeping or waiting for I/O). |
| mem   | Heap profile reports the currently live allocations; used to monitor current memory usage or check for memory leaks.                       |
| block | Block profile show where goroutines block waiting on synchronization primitives (including timer channels).                                |
| mutex | Mutex profile reports the lock contentions. When you think your CPU is not fully utilized due to a mutex contention, use this profile.     |
| trace | A detailed trace of execution of the current program. This will include information about goroutine scheduling and garbage collection.     |

Profiles for all cluster members will be downloaded as a zip file. Analyzing the profiles requires the Go tools to be installed. See [Profiling Go Programs](https://blog.golang.org/profiling-go-programs) for basic usage of the profile tools and an introduction to the [Go execution tracer](https://blog.gopheracademy.com/advent-2017/go-execution-tracer/) for more information.
